# Kalvium Lab | Change the font size

## Task: 
Your task is to create three buttons. The challenge is that, by clicking on any of the three buttons, the text above should change it's size -> based on the button clicked. For eg: if I clicked a button which have 14 px written on it, then the text above that button should change it's size to 14px.

## Starter code

Inside your `index.html` file -> all the buttons + text is already defined and written for you. Even the styling part is done for this lab. So you don't need to worry about styling as well.
You just need to edit `src/app.js`, and complete the task.


### Progression 1:

Create a function `fontSize` which takes `size` as the argument.

### Progression 2: 

Inside `fontSize()` function -> return another function --> which changes the font size of the entire body.

### Progression 3: 

Call the function with three different values, and store those values in different variables.

### Progression 4: 

Use onClick event handler and to update the new values.



Happy Coding Kalvium ❤️
